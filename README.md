# Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Lab Techniques

This is the github repository for the laboratory experience on the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technique that I have done at INFN Laboratories in Legnaro for the "Introduction to Quantum Hardware" course.
NMR is a powerful method for studying atomic nuclei, molecular structures, and substance properties by utilizing radio waves tuned to specific frequencies.
In particular, we measured the typical relaxation times of coherence in spin phases.
